Update from Domain Expert Discussion

I met with the domain expert to understand how budgets, bids, keywords, and ACOS are evaluated in practice. Below are the key takeaways:

1. Budget & Bid Changes

Budget and bid adjustments are not rule-based or fixed.

They depend on:

Product type

Campaign lifecycle (new vs mature)

Past adjustments and how the campaign responded

Generic guidance (increase/decrease) is acceptable, but exact multipliers should be estimated from historical changes, not hard-coded rules.

2. Keyword Evaluation & Bid Logic

Keyword evaluation depends on placement:

Top of Search (organic presence):

Judged mainly by ACOS

Not Top of Search:

Judged by conversion rate

High clicks with no conversions = bad keyword

Rest of Search placements can naturally have lower conversion, which may still be acceptable depending on the product.

3. ACOS Benchmarks

Acceptable ACOS is category-specific:

Gourmet products: ~30% is good

Bedsheets: ~20% is good

Reasoning:

Products that require more research (e.g., shoes, clothes) naturally have lower conversion and higher acceptable ACOS.

Standard products (e.g., bedsheets) require less research and should perform more efficiently.

4. Keyword Pausing Rules

Keywords are paused when performance does not improve over time.

Example:

Keyword live ~20 days

Receives clicks but no conversions

Action: pause or replace keyword

Clicks alone are not enough; trend and improvement matter.

5. Benchmarks & “Optimal” Values

There are no universal benchmarks for:

Keywords

Bids

ACOS

These are custom per product/category.

Benchmarks can be created using historical data (e.g., clustering or segmentation).

Final “optimal” values should be data-driven and category-specific.

Proposed Next Steps

Move away from fixed multipliers

Replace hard-coded budget/bid changes (e.g., +50%) with:

Ranges derived from past successful adjustments

Introduce category-level benchmarks

Group products by category and behavior

Define:

Target ACOS ranges

Expected conversion rates

Impression/click thresholds

Placement-aware keyword logic

Evaluate keywords differently based on:

Top of Search

Rest of Search

Avoid treating all placements the same.

Time + data thresholds for keywords

Require:

Minimum days live

Minimum clicks

Then decide:

Keep

Downbid

Pause

Build adaptive benchmarks

Use historical data (e.g., clustering) to:

Define “good” vs “bad” keywords

Recommend bid and budget adjustments within realistic ranges
